# Arithmetic Operator

print(8+2)   # Addition
print(3-1)   # Substraction
print(9/2)   # Division
print(5*6)   # Multiplication
print(9//2)  # Floor Division -> It will return only integer value after division
print(3**4)  # Exponention
print(7%5)   # Modulo -> It gives remainder after division

# Comparison Operator

print( 3 > 5) 
print(4 < 8)
print( 1 <= 6)
print(9 >= 7)
print(8 == 0)
print(2 != 0)

# Logical Operator

if 3>2 and 3>1 :
    print("3 is greator in both condition")
if 5<4 or 5<8 :
    print("5 is smallest or greator")
if not 7>8 :
    print("7 is not greator then 8")
